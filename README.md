# MAMEE Monster in The Mystery of the Missing Map
The licensed video game they never made featuring Malaysia's best-known ramen-based snack mascot.

## A Brief History
The video game industry in the 1990s were rife with what is called the "Mascot Platformer". These were games that usually featured an animal (but not necessarily), represented in marketing as the mascot of a particular gaming system, and usually had the player control a character on a series of stages with "platforms", hence the name.

Famous examples are the Super Mario Bros (mascot for Nintendo), Sonic the Hedgehog (mascot for Sega), and Crash Bandicoot (commonly referred to as the mascot for the Sony Playstation, but was owned by Activision).

There were also other games featuring mascots but were only had various amounts of success, such as Aero the AcroBat, Spyro the Dragon, Earthworm Jim, just to mention a few. Other companies such as McDonald's and 7-up also tried to leverage the popularity of the Mascot Platformer genre by releasing games featuring their characters such as Ronald McDonald and Cool Spot.

So it would be no surprise that if MAMEE had licensed out their own mascot, it would have fit in very well with the rest of the pantheon of mascot platformers of the period. But being Malaysian, having a licensed video game based on their IP would not have made much sense at the time, as software piracy was rampant in the country and the MAMEE brand wasn't quite established or well-known beyond Southeast Asia.

Therefore this game demo is a thought experiment of what could have been if MAMEE _did_ go through with publishing a video game based on their mascot, and had chosen the gaming system that was most prevalent globally in the 90s due to its relatively cheap cost and portability, the Nintendo Game Boy.
